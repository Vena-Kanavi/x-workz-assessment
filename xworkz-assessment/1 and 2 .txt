1)What is the difference between compile time and runtime?
=>Compile time is the time at which source code is converted to the byte code that is .class file that is executable code.
    runtime is the time at which the executable code starts running.


2)Explain types of variables with example.
=>There are two types of variables class variables and local variables.
class variables nothing but fields,these variables can be assessed anywhere in that perticular class.Local variables are only assessed within the perticular method only.
ex: public class Welcome{
     public static void main(String[] args){
     }
     public static void printWish(String printwish){
	System.out.println("saying "+printwish);
	String wish="hello";                                //local variable
	System.out.println("saying "+wish);
	} 
    } 
	
ex:public class Welcome{
    private static String wish;                     //field or class variable
	}
